Overview: This JavaScript code is used to randomly sample profiles from the Qualtrics library and display two of them at a time to the respondent. 
It also makes note of the attributes of the profiles that are shown and saves these attributes as embedded data. 
The embedded data appears in the resulting data frame of responses, providing all data necessary for the researcher to analyze the data as a conjoint. 

How to modify this code for your purposes: There are three "repetitive sections" of the code. 
The first is the list of links to the profile images in the Qualtrics library. 
The second creates an identifier for each image. 
The third specifies the attributes that are included in each profile image. 

Modifying all of these sections by hand would be incredibly tedious and it would be very easy to make mistakes. 
To automate the process, I have written code that automatically generates these lists. 
When you run the "Conjoint v3 all profiles.py" file, a data frame is created which contains a row for each profile, and columns for profile identifiers and profile attributes. 
Once you upload the profile images created by the Python code to Qualtrics, you should then run the "Scraping Qualtrics.qmd" file. 
This file scrapes your Qualtrics library to obtain the links to the profile images. 
It then reads in the data frame that was created by the Python code and adds the links as a new column to the data frame. 
It then modifies the data frame to create new columns containing strings that are formatted for JavaScript - i.e. they are formatted exactly as the "repetitive sections" are. 
Once this is done, you can just copy the resulting columns and paste them directly into this JavaScript code by hand. 

If your survey contains more than one conjoint choice question (task), you will need to modify the counter ("_1") for each question. 
For example, if you have the following line in your code for choice question #1 (var profileIdentifier1_1 = imageIdentifiers_1[selectedImage1_1];), you should change it to (var profileIdentifier1_2 = imageIdentifiers_2[selectedImage1_2];) for choice question #2. 

Other things you have to do by hand:
1. Setting embedded data - you must go to the "Survey Flow" tab in Qualtrics and set embedded data fields for each attribute of each profile of each choice. 
  For example, if you have 4 attributes per profile, 2 profiles per choice question, and 5 choice questions in your survey, then you need to set 4x2x5 = 40 embedded data fields 
  (e.g. if one attribute is "cost", set Cost_1_A and Cost_1_B for the cost attribute fields for the two profiles in the first choice question). 
2. Writing HTML code for each choice question - The code in the "JavaScript Qualtrics file" goes in the JavaScript editor of the survey question in Qualtrics. 
  It must be accompanied by the following code which goes in the HTML editor of the same question. 
  Once again, if you have multiple choice questions, you should update the counter ("_1") for each.
